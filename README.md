# Random Colors Generator

This is a simple web application that generates random colors and applies them to a `div` element. Clicking the button changes the background color of the `div` and the color of the heading to the newly generated color.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the web page.
- `app.js`: The JavaScript file for generating and applying random colors.

## How to Use
1) Open index.html in your web browser.
2) Click the "Click HereðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆ" button to generate a new random color.
3) The background color of the div and the text color of the heading will change to the newly generated color.
